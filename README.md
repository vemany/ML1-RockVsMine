Rock Vs Mine
Rock Vs Mine prediction tool

This is my first machine learning project - Rock VS Mine Prediction.
In this project, I use Numpys, Pandas, and Sklearn libraries such as model selection, linear models, and metrics to create a prediction tool that classifies objects as 'rocks' or 'mines', from extracts of data mined from disparate data sources. 

The predictive nature of this generic code lends itself to varied applications that require data segmentation using partitions and related analysis.
